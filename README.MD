Why some categories(genre game) do not work when you try to fetch?
When I am fetching from /api/games - those games have declared "genre", but they are in other array (I guess).
Arrays = categories - like: shooter, sci-fi, action-rpg etc.
I am unable to fetch for those categories, because I can't 'download them with fetch.'
I did my best, but still I have to learn it.

Anyway. If you give me a negative response about my task, at least please give me feedback about my coding.
Best Regards, Jakub.
