# KONGSBERG - Recruitment task

## Technology / Frameworks used:

- React
- JavaScript
- Vite
- Scss (SASS)
- HTML
- API



I made a website, with API. Fetching from game database and displaying them.

On start, we have all game until we change Game Genre. Then we have display games depends on our action.

After clicking on game, that we choose, we are able to see more details about the game.

I am not providing my own API KEY, for obvious safe reasons.

Anyway. It was fun, to create this website! :D 
If you give me a negative response about my task, at least give me feedback about my coding.

Best Regards, Jakub.
